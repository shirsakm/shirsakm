## I do dev!
// TODO: Add introduction 

## Looking for my portfolio? üëÄ
I don't have one! Check out some of my cool projects instead!

### [üåô Nightlio](https://github.com/shirsakm/nightlio/)
My open-source mood logger and journal. I made it because Daylio sucked!

It's self-hostable, it doesn't sell your data, what more can you ask for? Turns out, a lot actually! Which is why I am still working on it. Think it's missing something? Open an issue. Think it's awesome? Drop a star! ‚≠ê

### [üîç Heritage Results Database](https://shirsak.ftp.sh)
Ever been annoyed by people who guard their grades like it's their Horcrux? Yeah, me too, so I scraped everyone's grades and made a website! If you study in [Heritage](https://heritageit.edu/), check it out!

Study in Heritage, but not in Heritage Institute of Technology? Shoot me a mail and I will scrape your institute's results as well!

### [‚ö° PokeBounce](https://github.com/shirsakm/PokeBounce)
Are you into Pok√©mon? Are you into auto-battlers? Boy, have I got the game for you! Well, I didn't make this, but I contributed a lot to the source code and I want you to check it out!

I also did data analysis and made graphs of the results to check which pokemon were truly OP. Wanna see my graphs? Check out the [original creator's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8eWTT5-3i4)!


## Look! It's my activity!
Hmm, looks like I have been pretty active recently, let's hope I don't fall into a slump again! ü§û
