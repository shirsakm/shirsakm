Hello! I'm a freelance software developer from India, passionately blending my life as a full-time student and JEE aspirant. I specialize in _full-stack web development_ and _Python scripting_, adept in using a diverse range of tools and technologies such as _Jekyll_, _Flask_, and _Tkinter_. Alongside my coding journey, I'm an avid chess player, proud to have competed in the _67th National School Games, India_.

Let's create something remarkable together!
